# 1) Android Controlled Metal Detector Robot

- Built using the 8051 microcontroller and the 555 timer IC for metal detection
- The robot is designed using DC motors and the direction of DC motors will be controlled by the commands received from the android application. 
- The status of the robot is sent back to the Android app. This project also uses interfacing of HC-05 Bluetooth module with the 8051 microcontroller.
- The metal detector consist of oscillator produces the alternating current passes throw the coil and producing alternating magnetic field.
